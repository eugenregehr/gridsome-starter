Today, A lot of developers are conversant with the `alt` attribute on images. I can say most of us know that it is one way of making webpages accessible but do we really understand the scope of the alternative text, when to make use of it, how to use it.

- it helps improve SEO for the webpage.

Writing good alt text for images is very important and shouldn't be sidelined. To show how important this is the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines document [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#text-alternatives) have it has the first rule which shows that it's really important.

## How to Use Alt Text
Typically, when adding an image to a webpage, we use the HTML image element to represent the image and the alt attribute on the image tag to give a description of the image. Here's an example:
